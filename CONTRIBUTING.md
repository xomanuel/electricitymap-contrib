# Getting Started

## Non-code contributions

There are several ways to help out without coding, these are primarily:

- Opening issues for bugs.
- Opening issues for data problems.
- Opening and/or participating in discussions about new data sources, features, and more.
- Opening issues when capacity data sources have been updated or changed.
- Finding new data sources, wiki page: [Find data sources][wiki find data sources]
- Verify existing data sources, wiki page: [Verify data sources][wiki verify data sources]
- Adding new or updating our existing translations, wiki page: [Translating app.electricitymaps.com][wiki translating the app]
- And more!

## Zone and exchange configurations

Static information about zones and exchanges are located at [config/zones][config zones] and [config/exchanges][config exchanges] respectively.
The zone configurations hold information such as the installed capacity, which parsers to use, fallback mixes, contributors and other keys that are required by our frontend and internal systems; and while similar the exchange configs hold the location, capacity, direction and parsers required.

## Parser guidelines

To get started with editing the parsers use the following steps:

1. Run `poetry install -E parsers` to install all needed dependencies.
2. Use `poetry run test_parser ZONE_KEY` to test any parser changes.

Note: This requires you to have [Python 3.10][python homepage] and [Poetry][poetry homepage] installed, you can see their respective installation guides here:

- [Downloading Python][python install guide]
- [poetry installation][poetry install guide]

### Parser information

For more detailed information about parsers specifically you can look at the parser [README][parser readme] located at [parsers/README.md][parser readme] with specific information about the parser functions located in the [parser/example][parser examples folder] folder

#### Example parser:

For an example of how a parser can look we have an example here: </br> [parsers/examples/example_parser.py][example parser]

### Formatting the parsers

We use [black][black homepage] and [isort][isort homepage] as code formatters for python which is automatically checked in the CI job `Python / Formatting`.

If this jobs fails and you need to manually format the code you can run `poetry run format` in the top level of the repository.

Check the [wiki page][wiki python code formatting] for more details and tips.

## Front-end guidelines

To get started with editing the frontend use the following steps:

1. Use `cd web` to go into the web directory
2. Then use `pnpm install` to get all dependencies installed.

Note: This requires you to have [node.js][node homepage] and [pnpm][pnpm homepage] installed, you can see their respective installation guides here:

- [How to install node.js][node installation guide]
- [pnpm installation][pnpm installation guide]

### Frontend structure

The frontend can be broken down into 2 main parts, the web app built [Vite][vitejs] and the mobile app built with [capacitor][capacitorjs].
Both of these share a common code base that is built upon [react][reactjs].

As a result we have a frontend folder structure that looks like this:

```
mobileapp
â”œâ”€â”€ android
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”œâ”€â”€ icons
â””â”€â”€ ios
web
â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress
â”œâ”€â”€ geo
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ api
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”œâ”€â”€ features
    â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
    â”œâ”€â”€ stories
    â”œâ”€â”€ testing
    â”œâ”€â”€ translation
    â””â”€â”€ utils
```

### State management

We use [Jotai][jotai homepage] that saves our state in primitive atoms, these live in [web/src/utils/state/atoms.ts][jotai atoms] and are then imported in the individual frontend files where it's needed. If you have a need to save the state for a new feature you should add a new atom to this file so we keep everything organized.

### Formatting the frontend

The frontend uses [ESLint][eslint homepage] and [Prettier][prettier homepage] as formatters for all code and this is automatically checked in the CI jobs `Prettier / Check` and `ESLint / Check`.

If these jobs fail and you need to format the code you can run `yarn lint --fix` in the `/web` folder to do so.

Check the [wiki page][wiki js code formatting] on formatting for more details and tips.
